# MarsWeather

This app displays weather data for the current Sol on Mars. The data is retrieved from the NASA InSight Rover (Mars Weather Service API) currently on Mars. Developed using Swift on Xcode, this app has been deployed to the Apple App Store for iPhone and iPad.

Mars Weather makes use of the Charts(https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts) and DeviceKit (https://github.com/devicekit/DeviceKit) Swift libraries.
